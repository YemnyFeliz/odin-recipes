                Al Pastor is a really popular way to prepare pork, famous in San Francisco's Mission District. It's a
                marinated roast pork. They make the most incredible tacos and burritos. This is inspired by those
                flavors.

            </li>
            <li>16 (6 inch) corn tortillas

            </li>
            <li>16 slices Monterey Jack cheese, divided

            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil

            </li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cabbage, divided

            </li>
            <li>½ cup roasted tomato salsa, divided

            </li>
            <li>1 large jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced - or to taste

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place dried guajillo and pasilla chiles into a bowl and pour in boiling water to cover. Let chiles stand 30 minutes to soften.

</li>
            <li>Cut pork tenderloins in half crosswise and in half again lengthwise again to make 8 long strips.

</li>
            <li>Drain water from chiles and pour in pineapple juice and vinegar. Add garlic cloves, chipotle pepper, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, cumin, and oregano. Transfer chile mixture to a blender and blend to make a smooth marinade.

</li>
            <li>Place pork into a resealable plastic bag and pour marinade over pork; knead bag several times to coat pork. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Refrigerate overnight.

</li>
            <li>Preheat outdoor grill (preferably charcoal) for high heat and lightly oil the grate.

</li>
            <li>Remove pork from bag and drain and discard marinade; transfer pork to a platter. Drizzle meat with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and season with salt. Use tongs to gently stir pork pieces to coat lightly with oil.

</li>
            <li>Cook pork strips on preheated grill until meat shows good grill marks and is lightly pink in the center, 7 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the largest piece should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer pork to a fresh platter.

</li>
            <li>Drizzle a nonstick skillet with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Lay a tortilla into the hot oil and place 1 slice of Monterey Jack cheese into center of the tortilla. Cook until tortilla is hot, lightly browned on the bottom, and cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining tortillas and cheese slices. Transfer each tortilla to a plate.

</li>
            <li>Slice pork strips across the grain into pieces about 1/4 inch thick. Divide shredded cabbage onto each tortilla and top each with about 6 slices of pork, 1 tablespoon roasted tomato salsa, and a few slices of jalapeno pepper. Fold taco over fillings to eat.

</li>
